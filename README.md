### Description

`LightConvex` is an experiment about writing convex programming solvers in Modern Fortran. It aims at providing an easy-to-use API for solving both dense and sparse convex programs, including [linear programs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_programming) and [quadratic programs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadratic_programming). While we strive for an intuitive user interface, we do not compromise with computational performances and make extensive use of Modern Fortran constructs for the implementation of battle-tested algorithms. The current version of `LightConvex` focuses on designing the structure of the package and its interface. For that purpose, `LightConvex` is thus currently restricted to linear programs.
